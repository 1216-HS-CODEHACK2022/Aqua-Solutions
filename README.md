# Aqua-Solutions
Aqua Solution helps in self efficiency. It is essentially a
device that uses a modified version of drip irrigation
which minimalizes the loss of water and optimizes the
growth of a plant. Topic is made using Artificial
Intelligence by the help of Arduino which is an opensource electronics platform based on hardware and
software.
It was made using an Arduino which helps sense
whether the soil is wet or not; If the soil has less
moisture, it will tell the water pump to supply water to it
and if the soil already has moisture in it, then the water
pump will stop.
It is a very easy to use device and it also saves you a
bunch of time watering the plants.
